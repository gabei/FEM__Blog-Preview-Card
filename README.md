## The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My Approach
I wanted to make good use of Sass's nesting styles functionality in this project. Since the card is designed as a reusable component, I wanted to compartmentalize the styles under the `card` umbrella. I think that <a href="https://github.com/gabei/FEM__Blog-Preview-Card/blob/main/style/index.scss">worked nicely</a>.
